  Day follows night; and night<br />
  The dying day: stars rise, and set, and rise:<br />
  Earth takes th' example. See, the summer gay,<br />
  With her green chaplet, and embrosial flowers,<br />
  Droops into pellid autumn: winter grey,<br />
  Horrid with frost, and turbulent with storm,<br />
  Blows autumn and his golden fruits away;<br />
  Then melts into the spring, soft spring, with breath<br />
  Favonian, from warm chambers of the south,<br />
  Recalls the first. All to reflourish, fades:<br />
  As in a wheel, all sinks, to re-ascend,<br />
  Emblems of man, who passes, not expires.<br />

<h3>
  FEBRUARY.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The snow has left the cottage roof;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thatch-moss grows in brighter green;<br />
  And eaves in quick succession drop,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where grinning icicles have been,<br />
  Pit-patting with a pleasant noise<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tubs set by the cottage door;<br />
  While ducks and geese with happy joys<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunge in the yard-pond brimming o'er.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The small birds think their wants are o'er<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the snow hills fret again,<br />
  And from the barn's chaff-littered door<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betake them to the greening plain.<br />
  The woodman's robin startles coy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer to his elbow comes<br />
  To peck, with hunger's eager joy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong mossy stumps the littered crumbs.<br />

  On all green places where ye blow,<br />
  Tenderest thoughts of GOD that grow,<br />

  Hidden hearts that, lying low,<br />
  Sweeten all about you so,<br />

  The love of youth is in your breath,<br />
  Love of youth more strong than death,<br />

  Gathered in the greening glade,<br />
  And on lips of promise laid,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violets! March violets!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Other sweetness, too, ye take,<br />
  Often kept for saddest sake&mdash;<br />
  Kept for soft'ning old regrets&mdash;<br />
  To hearts throbbing ye are prest,<br />
  Ye are laid on hearts at rest,<br />

<h3>
  APRIL.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Emblem of life, see changeful April sail<br />
  In varying vest along the shadowy skies,<br />
  Now bidding Summer's softest zephyrs rise,<br />
  Anon recalling Winter's stormy gale,<br />
  And pouring from the cloud her sudden hail:<br />
  Then smiling through the tear that dims her eyes,<br />
  While Iris with her braid the welkin dyes,<br />
  Promise of sunshine not so prone to fail.<br />
  So, to us sojourners in life's low vale,<br />
  The smiles of Fortune flatter to deceive,<br />
  While still the Fates the web of misery weave,<br />
  So Hope exultant spreads her airy sail,<br />
  And from the present gloom the soul conveys<br />
  To distant summers and far happier days.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Hail! Fairy Queen, adorned with flowers,<br />
  Attended by the smiling hours,<br />
  'Tis thine to dress the rosy bowers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In colours gay;<br />
  We love to wander in thy train,<br />
  To meet thee on the fertile plain,<br />
  To bless thy soft, propitious reign,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lovely May!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Tis thine to dress the vale anew<br />
  In fairest verdure bright with dew,<br />
  And harebells of the mildest blue<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile in thy way;<br />
  Then let us welcome pleasant spring,<br />
  And still the flowery tribute bring,<br />
  And still to thee our carol sing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lovely May!<br />

<h3>
  JUNE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Come, June! and with beauty fill the earth.<br />
  Long have we waited for thy clear blue sky;<br />
  Though May is sweet she lacks thy constancy,<br />
  And chilly winds oft break the glad world's mirth.<br />
  Of lovely flowers ad buds there is no dearth;<br />
  Far overhead the swift-winged swallows fly,<br />
  And watching earth's fair beauty wonder why<br />
  They stayed so long in lands of lesser worth.<br />
  Lightly the lark mounts up to greet the day,<br />
  Forgetful of the Winter's bitter cold;<br />
  At eve the nightingale's melodious lay<br />
  Charms all the world to slumber as of old.<br />
  Ah, sweetest month, would thou couldst with us stay;<br />
  Too soon the tale of thy glad days is told.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  JULY.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Now is there silence through the summer woods,<br />
  In whose green depths and lawny solitudes<br />
  The light is dreaming: voicings clear ascend<br />
  Now from no hollow where glad rivulets wend,<br />
  But murmurings low of inarticulate moods,<br />
  Softer than stir of unfledged cushat broods,<br />
  Breathe, till o'er-drowsed the heavy flower-heads bend.<br />
  Now sleep the crystal and heat-charmed waves<br />
  Round white, sun-stricken rocks, the noontide long,<br />
  Or, 'mid the coolness of dim-lighted caves,<br />
  Sway in a trance of vague deliciousness.<br />

<h3>
  AUGUST.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  How fair a sight, that vest of gold,<br />
  Those wreaths that August's brow enfold!<br />
  Oh, 'tis a goodly sight, and fair,<br />
  To see the fields their produce bear.<br />
  Waved by the breeze's lingering wing,<br />
  So think, they seem to laugh and sing,<br />
  And call the heart to feel delight,<br />
  Rejoicing in the bounteous sight;<br />
  And call the reaper's skilful hand<br />
  To cull the riches of the land!<br />
  'Tis fair to see the farmer build,<br />
  Now here, now there, throughout the field,<br />
  With measuring eye correct, that leaves<br />
  Fit space between the numbered sheaves.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  SEPTEMBER.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Now had the season returned when . . . .<br />
  Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,<br />
  Desolate northern bays, to the shores of tropical islands.<br />
  Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September<br />
  Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel . . . . .<br />
  Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape<br />
  Lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood.<br />
  Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean<br />
  Was for a moment consoled.<br />
  All sounds were in harmony blended.<br />

<h3>
  OCTOBER.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Ay, thou art welcome, heaven's delicious breath,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When woods begin to wear the crimson leaf,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suns grow meek, and the meek suns grow brief,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the year smiles as it draws near its death.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind of the sunny south! Oh, still delay<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gay woods and in the golden air,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to a good old age released from care,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journeying, in long serenity, away,<br />
  In such a bright, late quiet, would that I<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might wear out life like thee, 'mid bowers and brooks,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, dearer yet, the sunshine of kind looks,<br />
  And music of kind voices ever nigh;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when my last sand twinkled in the glass,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass silently from men, as thou dost pass.<br />

<h3>
  NOVEMBER.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Dark visaged visitor, who comest here,<br />
  Clad in thy mournful tunic, to repeat<br />
  (While glooms and chilling rains enwrap thy feet)<br />
  The solemn requiem of the dying year;<br />
  Not undelightful to my list'ning ear<br />
  Sound thy dull showers, as o'er my woodland seat<br />
  Dismal and drear the leafless trees they beat:<br />
  Not undelightful, in their wild career,<br />
  Is the wild music of thy howling blasts,<br />
  Sweeping the grove's long aisle, while sullen Time<br />
  Thy stormy mantle o'er his shoulder casts,<br />
  And, rocked upon his throne, with chant sublime,<br />
  Joins the full pealing dirge, and Winter weaves<br />
  Her dark, sepulchral wreath of faded leaves.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  DECEMBER.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Tis done! Dread Winter spreads his latest glooms,<br />
  And reigns tremendous o'er the conquered year.<br />
  How dead the vegetable kingdom lies!<br />
  How dumb the tuneful! Horror wide extends<br />
  His desolate domain. Behold fond man!<br />
  See here thy pictured life: pass some few years,<br />
  Thy flowering spring, thy summer's ardent strength,<br />
  Thy sober autumn fading into age,<br />
  And pale concluding winter comes at last.<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
